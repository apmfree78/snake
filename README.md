# Retro Snake Game using useEffect, setInterval, and Object Oriented Programming

### Built with  React, TypeScript, Styled Components, & CSS Grid

Created Retro 1980's style Snake game, complete with retro font, layout,
and sounds.

### CSS Grid plus Styled Components for a Dyanamic Grid

Allowing players to dyanamicly change the grid dimension was tricky.
Cleanest approach I discovered was passing props through Styled Components
for the grid dimensions.

### UseEffect plus setInterval => Simple Game Loop

Utilized useEffect and setInterval to create a simple game loop that continued
until gameOver = true
